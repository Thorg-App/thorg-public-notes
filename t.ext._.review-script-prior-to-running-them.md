Remember to review scripts from internet prior to running them! 

Whenever you encounter someone on the internet asking you to run a script like

```bash
curl -fsSL https://some-script.sh | bash 
```

Make sure to look at that script by going to `https://some-script.sh` in your browser and, prior to running the script (`| bash` portion is what runs the script). If you aren't a pro of the language that the script is written in, then at least ask GPT/Claude/LLM-of-your-choice to review the script for whether it is safe to run and is free of doing anything malicious. By asking LLM a question as *"Is this script safe to run from security perspective?"*
