This is the [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)) on which [[Thorg Server|t.ext.thorgServer]] runs.

### How Port is Determined
The port is dynamically allocated when the Thorg server starts up. The server finds an available port and writes it to [[t.ext.data.type.workspace.thorg-dir.tmp.server.instance.port-file]].
