This is the [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)) on which [[Thorg Server|t.ext.thorgServer]] will run.

### How to configure
[[t.ext.configuration.values.startupSetup.serverPort]]

### QA
#### Why not auto-pick port on startup?
We use a stable port to make it easier to interact with Thorg Server outside of VSCode in the future.
