This command is similar to VSCode's built-in `git.closeAllUnmodifiedEditors` (which closes editors that have all their changes committed to git).

**Key difference:** This command does **NOT** close `Thorg` panels, whereas `git.closeAllUnmodifiedEditors` has the side effect of closing `Thorg` panels as well.
