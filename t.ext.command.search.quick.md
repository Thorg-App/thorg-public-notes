Quick search commands in this hierarchy use the VSCode quick pick widget for fast searching without navigating to a search view. This enables snappy searches, but comes with visualization limitations (such as the inability to widen the quick pick to fit longer note names).

If you use a non-standard zoom level in VSCode, you may want to adjust [[t.ext.configuration.values.visualPreferences.vsc_quickPick_maxLabelLength]].

See child notes in this hierarchy for the different quick search commands available, as well as [[t.ext._.highlighted-commands]].
