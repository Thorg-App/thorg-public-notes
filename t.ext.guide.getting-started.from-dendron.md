Thorg aims to work smoothly for those coming from Dendron.

Thorg looks for the `dendron.yml` file to identify the workspace and performs its [[t.ext.data.type.workspace.thorg-dir]] setup right next to it.

After installing Thorg, open your Dendron workspace and look for the Thorg activation message.
