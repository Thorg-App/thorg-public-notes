Configuration that defines the maximum amount of heap space allocated to the process running [[t.ext.thorgServer]] on a [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine). This depends on the number of notes you have.

Note that the maximum heap space does not mean all of it will be used, but it does influence when the JVM decides to garbage collect.
