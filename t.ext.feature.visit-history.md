### Summary
Visit history records your note visitation history per user, tracking where you have been and when. In V1, this enables navigation to recently visited notes. Future iterations of Thorg will use this for more elaborate features.

By default, history is stored under your user directory (only you have access to your visitation history).

### Does not track your brain
Visit history gives you a good idea of the notes you've opened recently to help filter your search. However, Thorg doesn't track your eyes or your brain -- just keep in mind that we can't guarantee a note visit included an actual read.

### Caveats
- A visit does not necessarily mean the note was read by the user. The note could have been opened without being read.
