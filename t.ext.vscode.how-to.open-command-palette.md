By default, the command palette is bound to the `Ctrl+Shift+P` shortcut. Per VSCode documentation: [VSCode tips and tricks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks)

### Command ID

workbench.action.showCommands
```
Change it through [[t.ext.vscode.how-to.change-your-keybindings-json]]

### Through Menu
You can find this command pallete by going through top level menu `View -> Command Pallete...`

### Name in Keybindings UI
In the keybindings UI configuration, the name is `Show All Commands`
