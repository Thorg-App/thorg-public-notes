By default, the command palette is bound to the `Ctrl+Shift+P` shortcut. Per VSCode documentation: [VSCode tips and tricks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks)

### Command ID
```txt
workbench.action.showCommands
```

### Name in Keybindings
In the keybindings configuration, the name is `Show All Command`
