Welcome to **Thorg** (Thought Organizer)!

**Thorg** is available as it's own **[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)** Plugin for knowledge management using [[hierarchical|t.ext.data.type.note.hierarchy]] markdown files. Local-first. Built for **scale** using multi-threaded Kotlin server for core logic. **Compatible** to be used alongside **[Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/)** plugin.


We are in the **early stages** of the product (even though it took quite a bit of development effort to get here).
But even at this early stage, if you are a current [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) user, we believe there is value in giving Thorg a try. We are working to fill the gaps to make Thorg fully standalone, and to implement more exciting features around the three pillars that **Thorg** focuses on:
- Search
- Visualization
- Refactoring

The following commands (and more) are available to try out now:
