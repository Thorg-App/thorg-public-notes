Per [[t.ext.file.home-thorg-dir.back-up-this]], this directory is a descendant of `$HOME/.thorg` and is recommended to be under source control.

If you're already backing up (e.g., source controlling) `$HOME/.thorg`, then this directory is already backed up as well as a descendant of `$HOME/.thorg`. If not, it's highly recommended to backup/source control `$HOME/.thorg` per [[t.ext.file.home-thorg-dir.back-up-this]].
