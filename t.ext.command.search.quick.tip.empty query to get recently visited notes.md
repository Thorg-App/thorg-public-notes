When using quick search commands such as:
- [[t.ext.command.search.quick.all]]
- [[t.ext.command.search.quick.in-subtree.all]]
- [[t.ext.command.search.quick.in-subtree.updated-since]]

To quickly access recently visited notes, just type a space ("` `") in the search query: **you will get the most recently visited notes** (see [[t.ext.feature.visit-history]] for more details).

Note: For a note to be considered visited, you must spend more than the [[minimum visit threshold time|t.ext.feature.visit-history.visit-event.min-visitation-threshold]] focused on that note.
