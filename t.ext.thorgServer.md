Thorg Server is a server written in Kotlin that runs on the JVM. It contains the core logic that powers Thorg functionality.

When the Thorg VSCode extension starts, it will start this server on [[t.ext.concept.serverPort]] if there isn't already a Thorg Server running for the [[workspace|t.ext.data.type.workspace]].
