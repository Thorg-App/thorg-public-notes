#### Don't let your knowledge be stuck in proprietary format.
</div>

**Transparent Data Model** means **you have full access to all the data Thorg creates and uses**, without obfuscation.

This goes beyond simply exporting to common formats—which often omit critical details. Instead, **you have direct access to 100% of the raw data** that Thorg creates, exactly as Thorg uses it.

We aim to store data in **open, human-readable formats** (example: *non-encoded JSON*), making it easy to inspect, parse, and manage.

When custom formats are needed for performance, we keep them in text format and document them thoroughly so you can parse them easily if desired. Example: [[t.ext.feature.visit-history.file.content-format]]. 

#### Where to find Thorg-created data
Besides the [[t.ext.data.type.note.frontmatter]] added to each [[t.ext.data.type.note]], the main places to look for Thorg-created data are:

- [[t.ext.data.type.workspace.thorg-dir]]
- [[t.ext.file.home-thorg-dir]]

#### Clarification
Transparent Data Model does NOT mean your data is accessible to anyone but you. It means you can understand what the data is. See [[t.ext.data.thorg-view-on-data.you-own-your-data]].
