- When you enter search terms without quotation marks, their placement in the note is irrelevant.
  - Use quotation marks around search terms to search for them in exact sequence.
- **Full words** match better. While search has some fuzziness enabled, aim to use complete words that you remember.
  - Example: If you remember the note has `in-hierarchy visited` but don't want to type "hierarchy":
    - ✅ DO: Try searching `in visited` to see if that's enough
    - ❌ AVOID: Typing partial words like `in hier visit`
