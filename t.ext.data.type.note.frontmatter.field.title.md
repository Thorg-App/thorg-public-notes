The frontmatter note title is stored within the FrontMatter of a note and is used to set a particular value for [[t.ext.data.type.note.data.title]].

An example note title set in frontmatter:

```yml
---
title: Note Title in Frontmatter
...
---
```

The note title use case is to have a display name for a note in visualizations and previews that is different from its file name.
