Fully qualified note name is the file path within the workspace without the .md extension.

For example, if you have:

```md
/your-workspace/vault-1/note-1.md
```

The **fully qualified name** will be `vault-1/note-1` (while the **name** will be `note-1`).

This is similar to a fully qualified class name in **Java**.
