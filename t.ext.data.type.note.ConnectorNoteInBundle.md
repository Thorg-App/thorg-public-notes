### Note Connector in Bundle
Note connectors in bundles serve as a linkage or intermediate note among other notes. Consider the following notes in a bundle:

```
a1
a1.a2.A3-1
a1.a2.A3-2
```

Here, `a1.a2` acts as the connector note. It could be a [[t.ext.data.type.note.stub]] or a regular [[t.ext.data.type.note]]. The key characteristics of a connector note are:

1. **Non-originality:** The connector note is not part of the original set of notes that were bundled.
2. **Linkage:** It serves to connect the original notes within the bundle.
