While for most use cases we expect visited-since commands to be the preferred time-based search filter ([[see why|t.ext._.setup-of-shortcuts.ctrl-t-setup.add-shortcuts.why-favor-visited-since]]), there are times when updated-since commands such as:
- [[t.ext.command.search.quick.updated-since]]
- [[t.ext.command.search.quick.in-subtree.updated-since]]

can be better suited for your search needs. The main use case is when you're **sharing** a [[vault|t.ext.data.type.vault]] with other people and want to search according to updates that others have made. In such cases, **you** haven't visited the notes they modified, so your [[t.ext.feature.visit-history]] won't reflect their visits. However, note modifications are always shared. Therefore, updated-since commands are more useful for discovering **others'** interactions with the notes.

If you're NOT sharing the vault or simply want to focus on your own note interactions, then visited-since commands such as:
- [[t.ext.command.search.quick.visited-since]]
- [[t.ext.command.search.quick.in-subtree.visited-since]]

will be more useful to you.
