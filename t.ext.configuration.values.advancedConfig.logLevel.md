Log level at which Thorg will log. Default is `INFO`.

### Regular Operation
Recommended to keep at `INFO` level.

### Switching to DEBUG When Submitting Logs
Switch the log level to `DEBUG` (or `TRACE`) when you have a reproducible issue and are collecting [[logs|t.ext.contact-us.submit-git-hub-issue.how-to.submit-logs.how-to-get-logs]] for [[issue|t.ext.contact-us.submit-git-hub-issue]] submission.
