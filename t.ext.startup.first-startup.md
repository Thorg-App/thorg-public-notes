On initial startup, Thorg presents a setup wizard that requests the following information. Expand the sections below to learn more about each item.

<details class="collapsible-with-transcluded-reference">
<summary>Thorg Username</summary>

![[t.ext.concept.thorgUsername]]
</details>

<details class="collapsible-with-transcluded-reference">
<summary>Machine Name</summary>

![[t.ext.concept.machineName]]
</details>

<details class="collapsible-with-inline-text">
<summary>Whether to auto-install Java (JRE)</summary>

On startup, you'll be asked whether to auto-install the JRE.

The recommendation is to let Thorg auto-install a JRE. This ensures you have a stable path to the JRE that [[t.ext.thorgServer]] can run on.

If you decide to provide your own path to the JRE, that's fine too. However, if the path changes (for example, if you update the JRE and it's installed to a slightly different path), Thorg will ask you to re-provide the path on its next startup.
