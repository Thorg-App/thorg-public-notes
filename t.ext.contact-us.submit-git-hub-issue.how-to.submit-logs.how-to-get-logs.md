#### Two ways of getting Thorg logs

- [[Use command to gather logs for you (Recommended)|t.ext.command.logs.capture.combined.recent]] 
- [[t.ext.contact-us.submit-git-hub-issue.how-to.submit-logs.how-to-get-logs.manually]]


#### If the Issue Is Reproducible: please use DEBUG logging.
If you can reproduce the issue, it would be ideal if you could send us logs at **DEBUG** log level by changing the [[t.ext.configuration.values.advancedConfig.logLevel]] setting.
