To de-risk sharing any user information publicly, please do **NOT** directly attach your user logs to GitHub issues (which you submit [[here|t.ext.contact-us.submit-git-hub-issue]]). That said, logs will help us **greatly** in triaging your issue, and we would very much appreciate if you voluntarily share your logs with us through a private communicadtion channel.

### How to Get Logs

If you would like to share your Thorg logs, please create the [[issue|t.ext.contact-us.submit-git-hub-issue]] with the following heading:

```txt
### LOGS
I was able to email logs to contact@thorg.app and included the GitHub issue ID in the subject: Yes

#### 2) Share Your Logs by Sending Us an Email
Email the logs (as an attachment) to [[t.ext.contact-us.email]] with the subject line:

### Log deletion
Your logs will only be used to diagnose the issue you've reported and we (Thorg) will **completely** delete your logs in a timely manner.
