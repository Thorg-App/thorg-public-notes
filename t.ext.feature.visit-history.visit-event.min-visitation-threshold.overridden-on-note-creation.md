[[t.ext.feature.visit-history.visit-event.min-visitation-threshold]] is NOT taken into account when you create a brand new note. During creation, even if you did NOT spend the time to meet the minimum visitation threshold, we will still record a [[t.ext.feature.visit-history.visit-event.FOCUS]] for the newly created note.
