As of the Alpha release, Thorg comes **ready** for keyboard shortcuts but does NOT have pre-configured shortcuts. We assume our users' keyboards are already heavily loaded with shortcuts. Therefore, we propose adjusting existing shortcuts to use two-chord combinations, making room for an array of hot-keyed commands.

For now, we provide shortcut recommendations but leave the actual setup in your hands. If we receive feedback that you agree with our recommended approach, we will automate this shortcut setup.

Below we offer recommendations for a shortcut schema, with snippets you can add to your [[keybindings.json|t.ext.vscode.how-to.change-your-keybindings-json]].

Also, regarding `keybindings.json`, we recommend you [[t.ext.tip.vscode.source-control.your-keybindings]].

## Approach: Ergonomic Two-Key Shortcuts That Are Easy to Remember

The suggested approach for creating shortcuts is to use multi-chord shortcuts that are **both**:
- Ergonomically accessible
- Easy to remember

Before we get into the suggested shortcuts, let's make a small keyboard adjustment that makes a world of difference for hand ergonomics:

</details>


Now that CTRL lives on the home row and we can use `CTRL+<SomeKey>` shortcuts with ease, let's start with our first multi-chord entry point: `CTRL+t`
